Task 3: Python

Shebang meaning: 
The shebang line #!/usr/bin/env python3 tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script. It allows the script to run directly from the terminal without explicitly calling 'python'.

Command to run without typing python:
chmod +x hello.py
./hello.py

Task 4: C

Reason C requires compilation:
C is a compiled language. The source code must be converted into machine code by a compiler before it can run, unlike Python which is interpreted and can run directly.

Command to compile and run:
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello

Interpreter vs Compiler:
- Interpreter (Python): Executes code line by line at runtime.
- Compiler (C): Translates entire source code into machine code before execution.
